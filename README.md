## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Build

Build the project and export the output  
```bash
yarn build
```

## Deploy on Vercel

Manual deploy
```bash
firebase deploy
```

However the project uses github's action worflow pipeline which allows automatic deployment when change is pushed to the main branch


## TODO  

Ideas to improve on  
- Automatic highlight on TOC as user scroll between sections
- Categorize the posts
- Change next's default style on post list page
- Add mobile version

**Bug**
- Post can't be opened via its url
-
